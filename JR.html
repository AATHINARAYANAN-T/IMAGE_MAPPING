<p><b>Jharkhand (English: /ˈdʒɑːrkənd/; Hindi pronunciation: [d͡ʒʱɑːɾkʰəɳɖ]; meaning "The land of forests") is a state in eastern India.[6] The state shares its border with the states of Bihar to the north, Uttar Pradesh to the northwest, Chhattisgarh to the west, Odisha to the south and West Bengal to the east. It has an area of 79,710 km2 (30,778 sq mi). It is the 15th largest state by area, and the 14th largest by population. Hindi is the official language of the state.[3] The city of Ranchi is its capital and Dumka its sub capital. The state is known for its waterfalls, hills and holy places;[7] Baidyanath Dham, Parasnath and Rajrappa are major religious sites.[8] The state was formed in 2000, from the territory that had previously been part of Bihar.

Jharkhand suffers from what is sometimes termed a resource curse[9]: it accounts for more than 40% of the mineral resources of India,[10] but 39.1% of its population is below the poverty line and 19.6% of children under five years of age are malnourished.[11] Jharkhand like its neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh, is primarily rural with about 24% of its population living in cities.[12] Jharkhand is amongst the leading states in Economic growth as compared to the neighborhood states. In 2017–18, the GSDP growth rate of state was at 10.22%.</b></p>
